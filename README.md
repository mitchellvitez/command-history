# Command History

Manages history of entered commands, allowing user to page through history. Also features prefix-based autocompletion for easier lookup of past commands.

## Usage

`stack test` to run the spec tests

`stack build` to build the executable followed by `stack exec command-history-exe` to run an example program where you can enter dummy commands and see how the completion/paging works
